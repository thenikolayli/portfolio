# nikolayli.com

This is my portfolio website. I will add features and updates here and there, when I have the time. This website is like the Ship of Theseus, because everything original has been replaced.  This used to be a website made using only Django (no frontend, just html css js and Bootstrap), the old repository is nikolaylibackend.

I am self-hosting this website on a home server, I'm using nginx as the reverse proxy to manage all the connections.
